# What is Open7Days? 

Open 7 days is an open-source engine based on some of the technology behind the popular game 7 days to die. 
Right now, the engine is in a super early stage, so when looking at the code, keep in mind that 99% of it is temporary and will be cleaned 
up in the future!

# What is the plan for Open7Days? 

The plan behind Open 7 Days is to eventually utilize the engine to create a game within in the same vein of 7 days to die. Right now, 
this is quite a far away plan but hopefully this will start being developed within the next few months. 

# How can I support the development of Open7Days? 

Right now, because the engine is in such an early stage, I advice you against actively working on it. Of course, if you see anything you 
see could be improved, feel free to open an issue / submit a request. 

# Current features implemented in Open7Days. 

* **Procedurally generated terrain with marching cubes**

* **Cascaded exponential shadow maps** 

* **Indirect diffuse lighting powered with cascaded voxel ray-tracing** 

* **Indirect specular lighting with screen-space + cube map raytracing** 

* **Screen-space-refractions**
